# openwrt-linksys-wireless
This repo houses various scripts, Dockerfiles, and packages to fix the wifi cutouts
on Linksys WRT\* devices.

All of this comes from the work done on the OpenWrt thread:

<https://forum.openwrt.org/t/users-needed-to-test-wi-fi-stability-on-linksys-wrt3200acm-wrt32x-on-openwrt-21-02>

Some additional context can be found here:

Known effected devices:
* WRT3200ACM
* WRT32X

Other devices may be effected. The community is still confirming.
